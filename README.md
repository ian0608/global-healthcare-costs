global-healthcare-costs
=======================

This project seeks to visualize: 1) The current state of global healthcare costs, and 2) whether or not more expensive healthcare is actually "better." This will be accomplished by comparing the costs of common drugs and medical procedures in various nations worldwide, as well as statistics such as life expectancy, doctors per capita, and health expenditures as a percentage of GDP.
